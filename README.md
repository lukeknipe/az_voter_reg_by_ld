# Arizona's legislative districts, by the numbers
This is a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) interactive choropleth map of Arizona's 30 legislative districts. On hover, the map displays voter registration statistics for that district, along with some other information. (On mobile devices, the map will do this on click.) The shades of red and blue indicate which way each district leans politically, according to voter registration data [published](https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/state_voter_registration_2023_july.pdf) by the Arizona Secretary of State.
